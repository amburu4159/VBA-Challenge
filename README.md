Summary: 
What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
Advantages of refactoring code is that you do not have to start from scratch. You take an existing piece of code that work, and try and make it better. The advantage here is saving time and not having to re-invent the wheel, plus if you can make it more efficient, it will be less taxing on the resources. 
The disadvanteage here is you could potentially break a code which was working before, and by the time you figure out where the issue is or how the code is written, you find that it might have been easier or faster to just write the code from scratch
